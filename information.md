## Brief description of different interaction process associated with `$$\alpha$$`, `\beta` and `\gamma` particles in air.
* **initStep**\
   It is not a Physics process but it reveals the initial position where the particle is created.
* **Transportation**\
    It is also not a Physics process but just the transfer of a particle to new position without any loss of energy.
* **ionIon**\
    The ionization caused by ions. Ionization is a process in which atoms or molecules acquire positive or negative charges by losing or gaining electrons. The positive or negative charged particles are called ions.
* **eIon**\
    Ionization caused by electrons.
* **msc**\
    Multiple scattering process. It is the mathematical formalism that is used to describe the propagation of a wave through a collection of scatterers.
* **eBrem**\
    The process of production of electromagnetic radiation during the deceleration of charged particle by the deflection of another localized charged particle.
* **phot**\
    The process of emission of electron from the atoms by the effect of incident photons (`\gamma` radiation).
* **Rayl**\
    The elastic scattering of the electromagnetic radiation by the particle with very small wavelength in comparison to incident radiation.
* **compt**\
    The scattering off of the photon (`\gamma` particles) by charged particle, generally by the electrons.
* **conv**\
    The gamma conversion process. It is a radioactive decay process wherein an excited nucleus interacts electromagnetically with one of the orbital electrons of the atom causing the emission of electrons from orbit.
* **annihil**\
    The process in which a particle and its antiparticle interact and disappear with the release energy. For example, annihilation of electron (`e^{-}`) and positron (`e^{+}`).
